In this set of analyses, I focus on the reaction times of starting game 2 (i.e., start RTs) and those of making a choice in game 2 (i.e., choice RTs). Here I use the complete dataset with 181 participants.

## Load libraries and data

```{r}
# load libraries
library(MASS)
library(Rmisc)
library(afex)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)

library(extraDistr)
library(loo)
library(bridgesampling)
library(brms)
library(cmdstanr)
library(bayesplot)
library(bayestestR)
library(tidybayes)
library(sjPlot)

# parallelize the chains using all the cores
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())

# set the theme for all ggplot2 figures
theme_set(theme_bw() +
            theme(legend.position = "top",
                  legend.direction = "horizontal"))

# create a folder for saving brms fits
if(!dir.exists("brms-fits")){
  dir.create("brms-fits")
}

# load the cleaned experimental data
df_exp <- 
  read_csv("../../../data/processed/df_exp_exp4_complete.csv")
```

## Start RTs

### Data preparation

Next I examine how quickly participants started game 2 after a win vs. after a loss, and also as a function of whether there was a delay or not.

```{r}
# trial number before any exclusion
n_before <- nrow(df_exp)

# exclude trials in which the start RTs were above 5000 milliseconds
df_after <- df_exp %>% filter(game2_startRT <= 5000)

# trial number after exclusion, and the proportion of excluded trials
n_after <- nrow(df_after)
exclude_prop <- round((n_before - n_after)/n_before * 100, 2)

# check the number of remaining trials in each cell for each participant
trials_count <- df_after %>%
  count(subject_ID, game1_outcome, delay)
```

Trials in which the start RT of game 2 was above 5000 milliseconds were excluded (`r exclude_prop`% of all trials). For the remaining participants, each cell in the 2 (game 1 outcome, win vs. loss) by 2 (delay, yes vs. no) contains at least `r min(trials_count$n)` trials, which seems reasonable.

### Mean start RTs

For each participant, I then compute the mean start RT (for game 2) after a win or a loss in game 1, depending on whether there was a delay or not. @fig-mean-startRT shows the mean start RTs as a function of the previous outcome and the delay condition.

```{r}
#| label: fig-mean-startRT
#| fig-cap: Mean start RTs for game 2 as a function of game 1 outcome and delay. Error bars stand for 95% within-subject confidence intervals.
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 5

# compute the mean start RT in each cell for each participant
df_startRTs <- df_after %>%
  group_by(subject_ID, game1_outcome, delay) %>%
  summarize(startRT = mean(game2_startRT))

# plot the results
mean_startRT_plot <- df_startRTs %>%
  summarySEwithin(measurevar = "startRT",
                  withinvars = c("game1_outcome", "delay"),
                  idvar = "subject_ID") %>%
  ggplot(aes(game1_outcome, startRT, color = delay)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = delay), linetype = "dashed", alpha = 0.5,
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = startRT - ci, ymax = startRT +ci),
                position = position_dodge(width = 0.5), width = 0.3) +
  labs(x = "Previous outcome", 
       y = "Mean Start RT (milliseconds)",
       color = "Pause")

mean_startRT_plot
```

### Median start RTs

Here I repeat the analysis above, this time using the median RT in each cell instead of the mean.

```{r}
#| label: fig-median-startRT
#| fig-cap: Median start RTs for game 2 as a function of game 1 outcome and delay. Error bars stand for 95% within-subject confidence intervals.
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 5

# compute the mean start RT in each cell for each participant
df_startRTs <- df_after %>%
  group_by(subject_ID, game1_outcome, delay) %>%
  summarize(startRT = median(game2_startRT))

# plot the results
median_startRT_plot <- df_startRTs %>%
  summarySEwithin(measurevar = "startRT",
                  withinvars = c("game1_outcome", "delay"),
                  idvar = "subject_ID") %>%
  ggplot(aes(game1_outcome, startRT, color = delay)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = delay), linetype = "dashed", alpha = 0.5,
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = startRT - ci, ymax = startRT +ci),
                position = position_dodge(width = 0.5), width = 0.3) +
  labs(x = "Previous outcome", 
       y = "Median Start RT (milliseconds)",
       color = "Pause")

median_startRT_plot
```

### Multilevel models

#### Fit model

Fit the data with a hierarchical regression.

```{r}
# since startRT is positively skewed,
# take the natural logarithm of the startRT as the dependent variable
# we add 1 to all observations because in previous experiments,
# start RTs sometimes can be 0, posing a problem for log-transformation.
df_startRT <- df_after %>%
  mutate(log_startRT = log(game2_startRT + 1))

# fit a brms model, with student's t as the likelihood function
fit_startRT <- brm(
  log_startRT|trunc(ub = log(5001)) ~  
    game1_outcome_num * delay_num +
    (game1_outcome_num * delay_num|subject_ID),
  family = student(),
  prior = 
    c(
      prior(normal(6.5, 1.5), class = Intercept),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = sd),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = sigma),
      prior(gamma(2, 0.1), class = nu),
      prior(lkj(2), class = cor)
    ),
  data = df_startRT,
  cores = 4,
  iter = 7000,
  warmup = 2000,
  seed = 1234,

#### Exploratory analysis

As suggested by a reviewer, here I add previous choice game outcome as an additional predictor.

```{r}
df_startRT_explore <- df_startRT %>%
  arrange(subject_ID, block_number, trial_number) %>%
  group_by(subject_ID, block_number) %>%
  mutate(prev_game2_outcome = lag(game2_outcome)) %>%
  # exclude the first trial of each block,
  # since it is not proceeded by another choice game
  filter(!is.na(prev_game2_outcome)) %>%
  mutate(prev_game2_outcome = factor(prev_game2_outcome, levels = c("win", "no-win")))

contrasts(df_startRT_explore$prev_game2_outcome) <- c(-0.5, 0.5)

# fit a brms model, with student's t as the likelihood function
# remove truncation, otherwise the sampling process takes very long.
fit_startRT_explore <- brm(
  log_startRT ~  
    game1_outcome_num * delay_num * prev_game2_outcome +
    (game1_outcome_num * delay_num * prev_game2_outcome|subject_ID),
  family = student(),
  prior = 
    c(
      prior(normal(6.5, 1.5), class = Intercept),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = sd),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = sigma),
      prior(gamma(2, 0.1), class = nu),
      prior(lkj(2), class = cor)
    ),
  data = df_startRT_explore,
  cores = 4,
  iter = 7000,
  warmup = 2000,
  seed = 1234,
  # refresh = 10,
  silent = 0,
  file = "brms-fits/fit_startRT_explore",
  backend = "cmdstanr"
  )
```

```{r, results='asis'}
# have a look at the summary of posterior distributions
tab_model(fit_startRT_explore, digits = 3)
```

### All trials (no exclusion)

In the analysis above, I excluded trials with start RTs \> 5000 milliseconds, in line with previous work. However, the Student's t distribution should be robust to extreme values (which were also rare). Here, I repeat the analysis above but with no exclusion, to see if the results remain the same.

```{r}
df_startRT_all <- df_exp %>%
  mutate(log_startRT = log(game2_startRT + 1))

# fit a brms model, with student's t as the likelihood function
fit_startRT_all <- brm(
  log_startRT ~  
    game1_outcome_num * delay_num +
    (game1_outcome_num * delay_num|subject_ID),
  family = student(),
  prior = 
    c(
      prior(normal(6.5, 1.5), class = Intercept),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = sd),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = sigma),
      prior(gamma(2, 0.1), class = nu),
      prior(lkj(2), class = cor)
    ),
  data = df_startRT_all,
  cores = 4,
  iter = 7000,
  warmup = 2000,
  seed = 1234,
  refresh = 10,
  file = "brms-fits/fit_startRT_all",
  backend = "cmdstanr"
  )
```

```{r}
# have a look at the summary of posterior distributions
tab_model(fit_startRT_all, digits = 3)
```

```{r}
# plot to what extent the model predictions capture
# the median reaction time per cell for each participant

# first, get 1000 posterior draws
yrep <- posterior_predict(fit_startRT_all, ndraws = 1000)

# turn the RT back to the original scale
yrep <- exp(yrep) - 1

# transpose the matrix and turn it into a tibble
df_startRT_pred <- t(yrep) %>%
  as_tibble()

# add the subject ID, prior outcome and pause condition
df_startRT_pred$subjectID <- df_exp$subject_ID
df_startRT_pred$game1_outcome <- df_exp$game1_outcome
df_startRT_pred$delay <- df_exp$delay

# compute the median predicted RT in each cell
# for each participant and in each draw
df_startRT_pred <- df_startRT_pred %>%
  group_by(subjectID, game1_outcome, delay) %>%
  summarize(
    across(V1:V1000, median)
  ) 

# compute the median observed RT in each cell for each participant
df_startRT_obs <- df_exp %>%
  group_by(subject_ID, game1_outcome, delay) %>%
  summarize(
    startRT_obs = median(game2_startRT)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    delay = factor(delay, levels = c("no", "yes"),
                   labels = c("No Pause (0 ms)", "Pause (3000 ms)")),
    game1_outcome = factor(game1_outcome, levels = c("loss", "win"),
                           labels = c("Loss", "Win"))
  )

# now compute the mean predicted median RT across 1000 draws
# as well as the lower and upper bound of the 95% CI
df_startRT_obs$startRT_pred <- apply(df_startRT_pred[4:1003], 1, mean)
df_startRT_obs$lowerCI <- apply(df_startRT_pred[4:1003], 1, quantile, probs = 0.025)
df_startRT_obs$upperCI <- apply(df_startRT_pred[4:1003], 1, quantile, probs = 1- 0.025)

# plot the results
df_startRT_obs %>%
  ggplot(aes(startRT_obs, startRT_pred)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lowerCI, ymax = upperCI), alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Observed median startRT (ms)", 
       y = "Predicted median startRT (ms)") +
  facet_grid(game1_outcome ~ delay)

# save the plot
ggsave("../plots/ppc_median_startRT_Exp4.png", width = 6, height = 5)
```

## Choice RTs

### Data preparation

Next I examine whether the increased sensitivity towards the EV ratio after a delay may be explained by participants making decisions more slowly in the delay condition.

```{r}
#| label: fig-game2-choiceRT
#| fig-cap: Histogram of all game 2 choice reaction times.
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4

# plot a distribution of all game 2 choice RTs
ggplot(df_exp, aes(game2_respRT)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5000, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Game 2 choice reaction time (milliseconds)")
```

To reduce the influence of a few long reaction times, I exclude the trials where the choice RT was above 5000 milliseconds.

```{r}
#| label: fig-game2-choiceRT-per-cell
#| fig-cap: Choice RT in game 2 as a function of game 1 outcome and delay. Error bars stand for 95% within-subject confidence intervals.
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 5

# number of trials before exclusion
n_before <- nrow(df_exp)

# exclude trials with choice RTs above 5000 ms
df_choiceRT <- df_exp %>% filter(game2_respRT <= 5000)

# number of trials after exclusion
n_after <- nrow(df_choiceRT)

# proportion of excluded trials
prop_exclude <- round((n_before - n_after)/n_before * 100, 2)

# log-transform the choice RT
df_choiceRT <- df_choiceRT %>%
  mutate(log_choiceRT = log(game2_respRT + 1))
```

### Mean choice RTs

```{r}
#| label: fig-mean-choiceRT
#| fig-cap: Mean choice RTs for game 2 as a function of game 1 outcome and delay. Error bars stand for 95% within-subject confidence intervals.
#| fig-width: 6

df_choiceRT_summary <- df_choiceRT %>%
  group_by(subject_ID, game1_outcome, delay) %>%
  summarize(choiceRT = mean(game2_respRT))

# plot the choice RTs
df_choiceRT_summary %>%
  summarySEwithin(measurevar = "choiceRT",
                  withinvars = c("game1_outcome", "delay"),
                  idvar = "subject_ID") %>%
  ggplot(aes(game1_outcome, choiceRT, color = delay)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = delay), linetype = "dashed", alpha = 0.5,
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +

       y = "Mean choice RTs (milliseconds)",
       color = "Pause")
```

df_choiceRT_summary <- df_choiceRT %>%
  group_by(subject_ID, game1_outcome, delay) %>%
  summarize(choiceRT = median(game2_respRT))

# plot the choice RTs
df_choiceRT_summary %>%
  summarySEwithin(measurevar = "choiceRT",

  labs(x = "Previous outcome", 
       y = "Median choice RTs (milliseconds)",
       color = "Pause")
```

### Multilevel models

#### Fit model

I use log-transformed choice RT as the dependent variable (truncated with a upper bound of log(5001), as above). Both game 1 outcome, whether there was a pause or not and their interaction are included as predictors.

```{r}
# fit a brms model
fit_choiceRT <- brm(
  log_choiceRT|trunc(ub = log(5001)) ~  
    game1_outcome_num * delay_num +
    (game1_outcome_num * delay_num|subject_ID),
  family = student(),
  prior = 
    c(
      prior(normal(6.5, 1), class = Intercept),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = sd),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = sigma),
      prior(gamma(2, 0.1), class = nu),
      prior(lkj(2), class = cor)
    ),
  data = df_choiceRT,
  cores = 4,
  iter = 7000,
  warmup = 2000,
  seed = 1234,
  refresh = 10,

#### Exploratory analysis

As suggested by a reviewer, here I add previous choice game outcome as an additional predictor.

```{r}
df_choiceRT_explore <- df_choiceRT %>%
  arrange(subject_ID, block_number, trial_number) %>%
  group_by(subject_ID, block_number) %>%
  mutate(prev_game2_outcome = lag(game2_outcome)) %>%
  # exclude the first trial of each block,
  # since it is not proceeded by another choice game
  filter(!is.na(prev_game2_outcome)) %>%
  mutate(prev_game2_outcome = factor(prev_game2_outcome, levels = c("win", "no-win")))

contrasts(df_choiceRT_explore$prev_game2_outcome) <- c(-0.5, 0.5)

# fit a brms model, with student's t as the likelihood function
# remove truncation, otherwise the sampling process takes very long.
fit_choiceRT_explore <- brm(
  log_choiceRT ~  
    game1_outcome_num * delay_num * prev_game2_outcome +
    (game1_outcome_num * delay_num * prev_game2_outcome|subject_ID),
  family = student(),
  prior = 
    c(
      prior(normal(6.5, 1.5), class = Intercept),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = sd),
      prior(normal(0, 1), class = sigma),
      prior(gamma(2, 0.1), class = nu),
      prior(lkj(2), class = cor)
    ),
  data = df_choiceRT_explore,
  cores = 4,
  iter = 7000,
  warmup = 2000,
  seed = 1234,
  # refresh = 10,
  silent = 0,
  file = "brms-fits/fit_choiceRT_explore",
  backend = "cmdstanr"
  )
```

```{r, results='asis'}
# have a look at the summary of posterior distributions
tab_model(fit_choiceRT_explore, digits = 3)
```

### All trials (no exclusion)

```{r}
